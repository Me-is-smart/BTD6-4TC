IMPORTANT: This repository is no longer supported. 4TCCC has moved to a new system, with new implementation in a new place authored by a new developer.

The 4TCCC Discord server (https://discord.gg/Gapyp6kw3b) is the new location for running this community challenge henceforth. The server uses a bot
to automatically find open combos, score completed challenges, and track the leaderboard. Make sure to ask any questions to either Lombre914#2310
(server owner), epicalex4444#5552 (lead developer), or The Mochinator#7904 (me, secondary developer) that you may have about the server or playing
the challenge.
